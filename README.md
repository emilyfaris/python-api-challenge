# python-api-challenge

In this challenge, I pull data using API keys to analyze and map weather in different cities.

In WeatherPy.main using openweathermap.org, I analyze how latitude affects different outcomes for a sample of 558 cities, and then use linear regression to see if latitude can predict these trends in both Northern and Southern hemispheres.

In VacationPy.main I use hvplots to plot the cities from the WeatherPy output, and using geoapify.com generate and map a list of hotels in cities with my ideal weather conditions.
